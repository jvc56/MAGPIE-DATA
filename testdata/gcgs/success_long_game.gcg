#note This turn destroyed me and I spent maybe 10 minutes tanking because I didn't know what to do. I really didn't want to open with 13H (SH)INOLA. F6 IO seems fine in hindsight #TIMESADDEST

#note I was already overtime and didn't want to have to deal with the Q. If he plays tiles, he's guaranteed to have the Q which he's stuck with. If he passes then the game ends in a six pass. Both of those scenarios were much more emotionally appealing than playing tiles and potentially drawing the Q, even if playing something is the best play. #timesaddest
