#note kenji told me a terrible CSW anamonic for RACIST literally the night before, and i remember it had a T in it, and eventually decided to not chicken out on this. i really didn't like it at all though!

#note ughhhh. i KNEW this was phony. i held forever but i couldn't be positive, and he held me for a while on astrict too so decided to not push my luck. need to be better.

#note i've consciously tried to become aware of not playing turnover just for the sake of it. so even though i saw ALLAYED, i liked the leave of N better than AELN. but maybe i'm wrong, it seems i don't bingo THAT much after AELN, and there are good letters out there... i don't know also, LEADY is better? -2.5

#note i also hate when i have to fish for the sake of Equity. obviously, this is also not a good play because i'm just giving up an easy-to-hit bingo lane for 7s. and.. O1 OE is a better fish too. Quackle likes 7C EOLIAN which is honestly hard for me to fathom. maybe turnover is actually important now. i'm giving up a lot of points though? i would play O1 OE. -1.5

#note not much of a choice here. i can't just give up 7 pts with BELON 5C and still possibly give up bingoes and points through the E.

#note i was starting to run dangerously low on time now, and he's scoring way too much to be able to outrun a bingo. it is perhaps best to play 3C HULA. quackle suggests he bingoes more often if i do UNSEX; there's probably a lot of stuff through the L, more than through the H or U in HULA? plus I could use the extra 5 points and turnover.  this is a hard move for me to make. intuitively it looks to me like 3C HULA will result in him bingoing more often but i seem to be wrong. -11

#note i think i need to block all 8s. this wins 60% of the time according to quackle, which prefers stuff like AB for a 74% win (!?). note that i think i win more than 60% because quackle will not miss 9s at the bottom.
